# VAEGAN implementation in Pytorch - with added interactive visualization
This repository is a simple MNIST implementation of "Autoencoding beyond pixels with a learned similarity metric".




## How to run
1. Run `python3 run.py` to train the model (this creates `model.pt` in the `checkpoints` folder.
2. Run `python3 visualize.py` to see the latent space for the model you just trained.

There are also pretrained weights available, so you can just do step 2 if you want.
